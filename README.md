# GNfiles allows to download/restore/update files used in GlobalNames projects

Working with multiple large files is cumbersome. To make it easier to download,
upload, and update files using a standard approach (IPFS in this case) allows
to keep data decentralized and reused with more ease.

This program is an exploration how to utilize features availabe at IPFS for
GN purposes.
